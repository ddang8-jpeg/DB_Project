We opted to utilize microsoft excel's built in transform funcitons to clean up most of the out datasets.
We first downloaded the full dataset as a .csv since out of the other options, it proved to work best with
excel. We then used the transform functions to clean up the data as it allow for the removal of null values and 
the deletion of columns. Due to one of our datasets being too large (several million rows) we decide on not utilizing it as we
were still using a total of 3 datasets. Once the they were cleaned up, we exported the datasets with excel into 
tab delimited text files.
