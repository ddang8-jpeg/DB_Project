Issues with phase C:
Problems with part as as the dataset we planned to use, as outlined in part A, were too big, as in several million rows. 
We had to make do with the other datasets and reconfigure our database saccordingly. The issue is that now our dataset may seem too
simplistic as it only fully utilizes one large dataset. We also had issues with using the text files in mySQL. We we getting an
issue where the foreign keys were not matching the keys of our other relation even though the data looked the same on the 
surface. It was also strange because it was only happening to two of our relations. Apparently it was due to how the .txt file 
was being read which resulted in a carriage return added which cause the keys to mismatch. We solved this by add the modifyier,
"LINES TERMINATED '\r\n' to our INFILE calls.
