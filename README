Databases Project Spring 2022.

changes made: changed the path of the import of the txt to be relative to the machine the code was on.

What does not work properly in this project:
Deletinng specie by its ID does not return sufficient explanation. The specie row gets deleted in the databse but there is no visuall proof.
Inserting new specie does not work as there are weird bugs within the php code that were not fixed in time.
